# Mouse steering on linux
This code takes you mouse x position and emulate a virtual joystick with its values.

---
## Setup and install
First you need to install the `python-uinput` package

| Distro | How to install |
| --- | --- |
|Ubuntu| sudo apt install python-uinput
| Arch | yay python-uinput |

In this example i used yay for arch, but you can choose any onther aur package manager

After this, install `pynput` using pip

```
    pip install pynput
```

I don't recommend use virtual environments for this code. 

Clone this repository:
```
    git clone https://github.com/Luisero/mouse-steering-linux.git
```

Go to project's folder:
```
    cd mouse-steering-linux
```

Everything is ready.

Run:
```
    python3 main.py
```
